# Challenge Description
This is a challenge to crease adversarial images to fool a MNIST classifier in TensorFlow.

## Description of Files
* fool_classifier.ipynb
    - This file contains all the code, analysis, and figures used to complete
    the challenge.
* *.pkl
    - These are pre-trained models used in the code. It is not necessary that
    they be in the working directory when running the code in the .ipynb file -
    in this case, they will be trained and generated (which can take
        considerable time).


### Technology required to run the code
* numpy
* matplotlib
* TensorFlow
* iPython Notebook
* Python2.7
